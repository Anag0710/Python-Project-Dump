# Python Project Dump 🐍

This repository contains a collection of small Python projects organized in batches. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates different concepts, libraries, or fun programming ideas.

## 📁 Project Structure

### Batch 1
- **snake_game.py** 🐍  
  Enhanced Snake game with modern UI using Tkinter. Features rounded snake segments, gradient food, restart button, score display, and background grid. Use arrow keys to control the snake and eat food to grow longer.

- **Staircase_Problem.py** 🪜  
  Dynamic programming solution to the classic staircase climbing problem. Calculates the number of ways to climb n stairs when you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. Includes memoization for efficiency.

- **Bouncing_ball_simulator/** 🏀  
  Interactive physics simulation of bouncing balls with realistic gravity and collision detection. Features:
  - Colorful balls with 3D visual effects
  - Interactive controls (SPACE to add balls, R to reset, ESC to quit)
  - Realistic physics with energy loss on bounces
  - Smooth 60 FPS animation

- **Create_calculator_app/calculator.py** 🧮  
  A modern calculator app built with Tkinter. Features a dark-themed UI, large buttons, and support for basic arithmetic operations, exponentiation, and decimal input. Includes a Quit button and error handling for division by zero.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed on your system
- Required packages (install as needed):
  ```bash
  pip install pygame  # For bouncing ball simulator
  pip install tkinter  # Usually comes with Python
  ```

### Running Projects
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Python Project Dump/Batch 1"
   ```

2. Run individual projects:
   ```bash
   # Snake Game
   python snake_game.py
   
   # Staircase Problem
   python Staircase_Problem.py
   
   # Bouncing Ball Simulator
   cd Bouncing_ball_simulator
   python ball_bounce.py
   ```
